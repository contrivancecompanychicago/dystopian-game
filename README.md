## What's It About
Players are introduced into a dystopian world where they are given complete control over the government. See how long you can last as a dystopian leader.

This is designed to be a turn-based menu driven console game.

The game is nowhere near complete or playable. The foundation is there. Try it out and let me know what you think.
