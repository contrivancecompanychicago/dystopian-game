## What's It About
Players are introduced into a dystopian world where they are a low-level politician. Through tactics and interaction with other characters in the game they gain power and rank in the political system. Players first seek to put their party into controlling power of the government and then later position themselves as a supreme ruler. All of this happens in a world where assassination attempts, bribery, and political crimes occur daily.

This is designed to be a turn-based menu driven console game.
